The first chapter introduces the basic concepts of atomic and molecular spectra, such as energy levels, transitions, selection rules, line widths, and intensities. The second chapter reviews the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory of hydrogen atom and its limitations. The third chapter discusses the quantum mechanics of hydrogen atom, including angular momentum and parity. The fourth chapter deals with magnetic dipole moments, electron spin, and vector atom model. The fifth chapter explains the spin-orbit interaction and the fine structure of hydrogen atom. The sixth chapter introduces the concept of identical particles and Pauli's exclusion principle. The seventh chapter describes the helium atom and its spectrum. The eighth chapter covers the multi-electron atoms, Hartree's field, atomic ground states, and periodic table. The ninth chapter presents the spectroscopic terms, L-S and j-j couplings, Hund's rules, and term symbols. The tenth chapter analyzes the spectra of alkali elements, such as sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium. The eleventh chapter studies the spectra of alkaline-earth elements and complex spectra, such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, radium, iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, mercury, etc. The twelfth chapter examines the Zeeman effect and Paschen-Back effect in atomic spectra. The thirteenth chapter explores the various types of lasers and their applications in spectroscopy.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with numerous examples, diagrams, tables, and figures to illustrate the concepts. The book also provides exercises at the end of each chapter to test the understanding of the readers. The book is a comprehensive and up-to-date reference for anyone interested in learning more about atomic and molecular spectra and laser techniques.
