The book is organized in 15 chapters, which cover topics such as filtration, centrifugation, adsorption, extraction and membrane separation as applied to bioseparations. The book also discusses the use of chromatography and related techniques such as gel filtration, affinity and pseudoaffinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, electrophoresis and related methods. The book highlights the important applications of these techniques in various fields of biotechnology, such as biopharmaceuticals, biofuels, biosensors and bioremediation.
 
The book is intended for postgraduate students of science and engineering and M.Tech. students who are interested in learning about bio-separations. The book is also useful for researchers and professionals who are involved in bio-separations or related fields. The book provides a systematic and well-balanced presentation of the concepts and methods of bio-separations, with examples and problems to enhance the understanding of the readers.
 
The book is available as an ebook for free download from various online sources. However, the quality and authenticity of the ebook may vary depending on the source. Therefore, it is advisable to purchase the print book from a reputable publisher or online store. The print book can be found on Google Books[^1^], WorldCat[^2^] or other online platforms.
  
Bio-separations are essential for the purification and recovery of valuable biomolecules from complex biological mixtures. Bio-separations involve the separation of biomolecules based on their physical or chemical properties, such as size, shape, charge, solubility, affinity and specificity. Bio-separations can be classified into two main categories: preparative and analytical. Preparative bio-separations aim to isolate and purify large quantities of biomolecules for further applications, while analytical bio-separations aim to identify and quantify small amounts of biomolecules for characterization and quality control.
 
The book Bioseparations: Principles and Techniques provides a comprehensive overview of the various techniques and methods used for both preparative and analytical bio-separations. The book covers the basic principles and theories behind each technique, as well as the practical aspects and applications of each technique. The book also includes numerous examples, diagrams, tables and figures to illustrate the concepts and procedures of bio-separations. The book also provides several problems and exercises at the end of each chapter to test the knowledge and skills of the readers.
 
The book Bioseparations: Principles and Techniques is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about bio-separations or enhance their skills in bio-separations. The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with a logical and coherent structure. The book is suitable for both beginners and advanced learners of bio-separations, as well as for teachers and instructors who want to use the book as a reference or a textbook for their courses. The book is also a useful guide for researchers and professionals who want to update their knowledge or improve their performance in bio-separations or related fields.
